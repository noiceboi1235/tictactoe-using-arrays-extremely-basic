# tictactoe-using-arrays-extremely-basic
tic tac toe made with java using only arrays
 I'm a student in class 10th and i am studying java currently, so i thought it would be cool to make a little game from the things i've been learning and combine all the concepts i've learnt so far and apply them into a project, its not something fancy, its just a little school project i made

To access the program, use any editor you'd like (which supports java), open the file and copy the code or directly open the file in the editor which you're using and enjoy :)
